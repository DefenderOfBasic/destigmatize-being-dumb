It's counterintuitive, but releasing my shame around being dumb has allowed me to be much smarter, I can make much better decisions now. 

This repo is a handy collection of writing on this idea that I can send to friends / that can help me talk about it when it comes up (_in the same way [nohello.net](https://nohello.net/en/) is super useful for communicating this idea to junior coworkers that it's good practice to avoid DMing people to ask "can I ask you a question?"_)
